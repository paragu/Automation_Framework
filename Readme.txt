
Hi,

Here I have automated a small flow of application which keeps track of outsourcing companies from login, 
navigation, create customer and success message. This project is based on page object model where we are
extracting data from excel sheet and using data provider we are executing our script. Also I have used 
Logger for recording each stepsand module driver to execute test cases with project and test case wise.

In this automation framework I have used below technologies: 
Selenium & Java using Page Object Model and TestNg.
